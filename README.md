# comp473s19project4

This is the repository for Project 4 of COMP 363/463, offered by Loyola University Chicago in Spring 2019. The owners of this project are Jess Conway and Sophie Von Hatten. The official guidelines for the assignment can be found in the Specifications folder.

This project is essentially a copy of Project 2, with the addition of implementations of the Visitor and Builder Patterns.

The Visitor Pattern is implemented in src/facilitymanager/model/inspection among all the files found within. In this new code, InspectionVisitor visits different types of Inspections.

The Builder Pattern is implemented in src/facilitymanager/model/facility within FacilityDetailImpl. You may now use FacilityDetailBuilder to build FacilityDetailImpl objects.

The initial submission of this project is due on 21 Apr 2019.
